# JsonToDB
## Using Python to read in JSON data and insert into database

- developed with Python 3.10.7, Postgres 13
- using ijson library to avoid reading entire JSON file into memory
- TODO: if I had time and/or was getting paid:
  - make SQL creation more dynamic, less hard-coded values
  - remove DB responsibilities from TripData class
